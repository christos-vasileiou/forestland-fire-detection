Wildfires is a major social problem considering that the  aftermath can be costly for the 
environment  (losses  of  animals,  properties,  cultural  heritage)  as  well  as  for  the  society, 
causing loss of human life. Many efforts have been made in order to develop applications or 
systems  able  to  detect  wildfires  early  and,  thus,  prevent  or  even  limit  their    negative 
consequences.  Using  satellites  may  limit  the  frequency  of  wildfire  detection  and  as  a 
consequence  the  correct  and  timely  assessment  of  the  situation.  The  solution  is  to  use  a 
system  capable  of  timely  fire  detection  on  the  surface  near  the  fire  spot  through  visual 
stimulation,  using    the  conjunction  of  two  disciplines  of  the  computer  science.  Artificial 
intelligence,  (and  specifically,  computer  vision)  in  conjunction  with  the  deployment  of 
hardware accelerators and embedded systems. My thesis is based on the architecture of the 
You-Only-Look-Once  (YOLO)  algorithm  which  is  used  to  detect  objects  with  specific 
features like color, shape, form, etc. The architecture acceleration runs on the Edge TPU of 
the Coral Dev Board device developed by Google, having the edge over other TPUs that it 
runs extremely power efficient.
